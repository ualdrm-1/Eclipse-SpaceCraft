# **Eclipse SpaceCraft**ðŸš€
An ordinary game of the **Asteroids** type - at the same time, it is the first project (_or rather, a personally interested activity_) in the field of gamedev.<br><br>
Since the design and construction of the game was carried out after a short and basic acquaintance with the **C++**, the code here is not very good(~~disgusting~~).<br><br>
At least one part of the entire **C++** spectrum is involved in the project - **OOP**.<br><br>
If you are interested, the following image - constructed hierarchy:<br><br>

There was also a choice about choosing a library: the very popular **SDL** or its less popular (_but, I think, not inferior in functionality_) analog **SFML**.<br>And to be honest, at the stage of acquaintance with both libraries, I liked the second one more. At that time, I was getting familiar with the implementation of animation and, as for me, it is much easier and more convenient to do it in **SFML**.<br>~~I do not miss the fact that I have not fully understood all the concepts of the SDL library~~<br><br>
In principle, that's all, screenshots from the game will be provided next:
